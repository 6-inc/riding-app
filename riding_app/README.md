# Overview

This app is designed a starter template.  It has some design opinions, and it will implement a simple set of features typical to any mobile app.  It should be easy to customize and get something ready for an app store.  It is not intended as the "toy" examples found in medium.com posts.  It is intended to be multilinguial ready also.  It is meant to be used with a backend.

The app itself is a task queue.  The user creates tasks and you are given 45 minutes to 15 minutes for the task depending on priority.  Tasks will be in shuffle mode or repeat mode until a task is marked as completed.  The idea is to create extreme focus for short periods.  Break mode and other ideas will be introduced.

## Features

### Offline First

The app should work without being online constantly.

### Core App

The core app demonstrates:
- user auth
- a task queue timer
- data saves to the cloud

### Localized

You can use this in more than one language.  The default supports two languages.  It is an exercise for you to add other languages, or contact us to build in more language support.

### Responsive

Works on a variety of new and old phone layouts, even tablets

### Open Source Software

This is intended to be open.  It should be "free as in freedom" and "free as in beer".  No surprises.  No hidden API keys needed.

### Maintained

A company called IoTone Japan will be maintaining this template with collaborators.  Plugin packages used in the app will be chosen and should also be modules that are maintained and OSS.
